# Meteor Package Integration Verification

## Package Existence vs. Integration

When discussing Meteor packages in the JustDo codebase, it's important to distinguish between:

1. **Package Existence**: Whether a package exists in the codebase (in repositories or submodules)
2. **Package Integration**: Whether a package is properly integrated into a Meteor application

A package can exist in the codebase but not be integrated into an application, making it effectively unavailable at runtime.

## Verifying Package Integration

To fully verify if a package is integrated and available in a Meteor application, you must check all of the following:

### 1. Package Existence

First, confirm the package exists in one of these locations:
- In `modules/justdo-packages/` (source-available packages)
- In `modules/justdo-ee-packages/` (enterprise edition packages)
- In `modules/justdo-bespoke-packages/` (client-specific packages)
- In the Meteor package ecosystem (published packages via Atmosphere)
- In the npm ecosystem (for npm packages used through Meteor)

### 2. Symlink Verification

Check if the package is properly symlinked in the application:
- For local packages, verify there's a symlink in `application/packages/` pointing to the package directory
- For example: `application/packages/justdo-accounts` -> `../../modules/justdo-packages/justdo-accounts`

### 3. Meteor Package Inclusion

Check if the package is included in the Meteor application's packages list:
- Open `.meteor/packages` in the application directory
- Look for the package name as it appears in its `package.js` file under the `name` field
- Example: If `package.js` contains `name: "justdoinc:justdo-accounts"`, then `.meteor/packages` should include `justdoinc:justdo-accounts`

## Example Verification Process

For a comprehensive integration check, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Find the package in the codebase
find . -type d -name "justdo-accounts"

# 2. Check the package definition to find its official name
cat modules/justdo-packages/justdo-accounts/package.js | grep "name:"

# 3. Verify symlink in application/packages
ls -la application/packages/justdo-accounts

# 4. Confirm presence in .meteor/packages
grep "justdoinc:justdo-accounts" application/.meteor/packages
```

## Package.js Extension: i18n Support

JustDo has extended the standard Meteor package.js API with custom i18n functionality:

1. The extension is implemented in the `000-package-js-i18n` package
2. It adds the global `addI18nFiles` function that can be used in package.js files
3. This function helps manage language file loading across the application

For detailed i18n implementation, see:
[030-i18n-files.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tasks/030-i18n-files.mdc)

## Common Integration Issues

1. **Missing Symlink**: Package exists but isn't symlinked in application/packages
2. **Incorrect Package Name**: Mismatch between package.js name and .meteor/packages entry
3. **Version Conflicts**: Two packages depend on different versions of the same package
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Package is added but its dependencies aren't included

## Checking for Active Plugins

Some packages act as plugins and require additional verification:
1. Check the package's documentation for activation requirements
2. Look for initialization code in the application startup sequence
3. Verify any required configuration settings are present
