## Codebase Structure
- `justdo`: Project root repository (the Community Edition)
- `modules/justdo-web-app-ce`: Web app CE repository 
- `modules/justdo-landing-app-ce`: Landing app CE repository
- Both app repositories have git submodules under their respective `modules` directories:
  - `modules/justdo-packages`: Source-available packages
  - `modules/bash-helpers`: Git submodule containing bash helper functions
    - Contains reusable bash functions used by both CE and closed-source versions
    - A symlink exists at the repository root: `helpers -> modules/bash-helpers/functions`
    - This symlink structure is identical in both CE and closed-source repositories
- Note that both app repositories reference the same git submodules, but may point to different commits
- When working on web app features, modify the submodules in `justdo-web-app-ce`
- When working on landing page features, modify the submodules in `justdo-landing-app-ce`

## Commands
- (The following bash scripts exists in the project root. If the current pwd is different, ensure to `cd` back to the root directory)
- Start dev environment: `./run-dev-environment.bash`
- Run full app tests: `./test-dev-environment.bash`
- Run tests and exit after completion: `./test-dev-environment.bash --once`
- Run a subset of tests: `MOCHA_GREP="<regex_pattern_matching_test_suite>" ./test-dev-environment.bash --once`
  - For example, to run tests with `describe "*+grid*+"` (name of suite containing grid), use `MOCHA_GREP="/grid/i"`
- Build for production: Handled by CI/CD pipeline
