# Terminology Clarification

## The Ambiguity of "Project" in JustDo

- The term "project" is ambiguous in the JustDo codebase due to historical terminology changes
- When JustDo started, **Boards** used to be called **Projects**
- Later, we started calling these **Projects** as **JustDos**
- Then we introduced a new concept also called **Project**, which refers to a task that is designated as a Project

## Current Terminology

- **Board**: A container for tasks and the current term for what was once called a Project
- **JustDo**: The renamed term for what was originally called a Project (now a Board)
- **Project Task**: A task that has been designated as a Project (the current meaning of "Project")

## Usage Guidelines

- When referring to the container for tasks, use "JustDo"
- When referring to a task designated as a Project, use "Project" for user-facing terminology
- Be aware that old code and documentation may use these terms inconsistently
- Add comments when necessary to clarify ambiguous usages
