# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Principles
- Valid test cases will always contain the `.app-test.coffee` extension
- When implementing tests, review the specific pattern used in similar files
- For comprehensive test creation guidance, see the full test generation guidelines in the tasks folder
@file .cursor/rules/tasks/010-test-generation.mdc

## Test Coverage Requirements
- All new features should have appropriate test coverage
- Bug fixes should include regression tests to prevent recurrence
- API changes require test updates to ensure continued functionality
- UI components should have basic rendering and interaction tests
- Complex business logic requires unit tests with multiple scenarios
