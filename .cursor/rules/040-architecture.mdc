# Architecture Guidelines

## Architecture Principles
- **Package-first**: Implement functionality as packages whenever possible
- **Package Organization**: 
  - Source-available packages: modules/justdo-packages (symlinked to application/packages)
  - Proprietary packages: modules/justdo-ee-packages (symlinked to application/packages)
- **New Packages**: Always create new packages in modules/justdo-packages (source-available)
- **Application Code**: Only use /application folder level code when necessary - always prefer packages
  - Place client-only code in /client, server-only in /server
  - Use /lib only when strict load order control is needed

## Package Exposures

Instances of a package may be exposed to different namespaces. Examples:
- JustdoAccounts is exposed as APP.accounts
- JustdoSeo is exposed as APP.justdo_seo
- JustdoHelpers is not a constructor; it is exposed globally and used as JustdoHelpers.getURL()
- GridDataCom is constructed as part of a Project instance

If a package has an app-integration.coffee file, it will typically show how the package is exposed.
Otherwise, perform a full code search (e.g., searching for "new <constructor_name>" or one of the package methods) to determine how to correctly access the package.
