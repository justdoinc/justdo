# Coding Style Guidelines

This file provides an overview of the coding style guidelines for different technologies used in the JustDo codebase. For detailed guidelines, please refer to the specific files:

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

- **Bash Scripting**: [031-bash-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/031-bash-style.mdc)
- **CoffeeScript**: [032-coffeescript-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/032-coffeescript-style.mdc)
- **Client-Side (HTML/CSS)**: [033-client-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/033-client-style.mdc)

## Common Naming Conventions

- under_scored for non-functions and Blaze templates
- lowerCamel *only* for functions and methods
- PascalCase for classes/constructors
- ALL_UPPER for global variables

## Core Philosophy

- Code is primarily written for humans to read and understand, not just for computers to execute
- "Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Readability counts."
- Maintain consistency with existing code style when modifying files
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Prefer verbose variable names and maintainability over concise code
